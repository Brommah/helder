## 2. Wkb Law Impact Analysis

### What is Wkb?

**Wet Kwaliteitsborging voor het Bouwen** (Building Quality Assurance Act)
- **Effective:** January 1, 2024
- **Scope:** ALL construction
- **Key requirement:** Mandatory opleverdossier (completion file) at handover

### Completion File (Opleverdossier) Requirements

Must include:
1. Drawings and calculations for completed building
2. Material descriptions and installation specs
3. Data needed for use and maintenance
4. Documentation demonstrating contractor compliance
5. Photos, structural engineer approvals, Building Decree calculations

### Compliance Burden

**For Contractors:**
- New documentation assembly process at completion
- Liability risk if file incomplete
- Payment withholding: Clients can hold 5% of contract price

**For Homeowners:**
- Need to receive, store, and maintain documentation
- Critical for renovations, insurance, resale

**Critical Caveat:**
- Completion file requirement is "optional law" (dispositief recht)
- Parties can contractually opt out
- Reduces pure regulatory pressure but increases contractual complexity

### Market Impact

**Projects Affected:**
- 100% of new construction contracts from Jan 1, 2024
- Estimated 68,000-73,000 residential units in 2024-2025
