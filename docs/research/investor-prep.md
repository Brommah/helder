# Helder (Woningpaspoort) - Series A/Seed Fundraising Prep

## TL;DR

Strong regulatory tailwind (Wkb mandate), clear pain point (€5B annual waste), family construction credibility differentiator. Position as "TrustPilot for buildings" not "blockchain for construction." Lead with compliance urgency, prove with pilot metrics.

## 1. Narrative Structure

### The Story Arc

| Beat | Message |
|------|---------|
| **Problem** | Construction miscommunication costs Netherlands €5B/year. New Wkb law requires 20-year document retention, but industry still runs on paper, WhatsApp, and lost USB drives. |
| **Why Now** | Wkb enforcement began 2024. Builders face liability without proof. 70K+ new homes/year need compliant documentation. Clock is ticking. |
| **Solution** | Helder creates a digital "passport" for every building - all documentation, certifications, and maintenance history in one verified, tamper-proof record. |
| **Credibility** | Built by Broersma Bureau - established Dutch construction expertise. We've lived this problem. Now we're solving it. |
| **Moat** | Cryptographic verification via Cere blockchain. Not just storage - proof. Can't be altered, can't be disputed, holds up in court. |
| **Vision** | Every building in Europe has a digital identity. Helder becomes the source of truth for property transactions, insurance, maintenance, and regulatory compliance. |

### Positioning Statement

> "Helder is the digital passport for Dutch housing - turning construction chaos into verified trust."

**Avoid:** "Blockchain construction platform" (triggers skepticism), "PropTech disruptor" (vague), "Digitizing construction" (everyone claims this)

**Use:** "Compliance solution," "Verified building history," "Woningpaspoort"

## 3. Investor Q&A Prep

### Tough Questions + Crisp Answers

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **"Why won't the big players (Autodesk, Procore) just add this?"** | They're US-centric, focused on large commercial. Dutch Wkb compliance is a niche they won't prioritize. Our construction network gives us distribution they can't buy. By the time they localize, we own the installed base. |
| **"Why blockchain? Isn't that overkill?"** | Not for legal compliance. Wkb requires proof documents weren't altered. Traditional databases can be edited. Blockchain verification makes our records court-admissible. It's the difference between "we stored it" and "we can prove it." |
| **"What's the competitive moat?"** | Three layers: (1) Family network in Dutch construction - deep relationships with builders, (2) First-mover on Wkb compliance specifically, (3) Cryptographic verification others can't easily replicate. |
| **"How do you scale beyond Netherlands?"** | EU's Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) requires digital building logbooks across Europe by 2030. We're building the playbook in Netherlands, then expand with same regulatory tailwind. |
| **"Is this a feature or a company?"** | Company. The passport is entry point. Revenue expands into: maintenance scheduling, insurance integrations, property transaction verification, energy audits. Each home is a recurring revenue stream. |
| **"Why you?"** | I grew up in this industry. Broersma Bureau has been in Dutch construction for decades. I understand both the tech (CMO experience at AI infrastructure company) and the industry (in my blood). Plus, Cere gives us enterprise-grade data infrastructure at cost. |
| **"What's your unfair advantage?"** | Day 1 pilot customers. Broersma Bureau network will use this. We're not cold-calling - we're solving our own problem with years of trust built in. |
| **"Revenue model?"** | SaaS per project (€250-500/project) + per-building annual fee (€50-100/year) for ongoing passport maintenance. Land-and-expand: builders pay upfront, homeowners pay ongoing. |
