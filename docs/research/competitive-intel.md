## 6. Positioning Gaps & Opportunities

### Gap 1: Buyer-Centric vs. Contractor-Centric
**Current Market:** 100% of construction tech built for contractors

**Helder Positioning:**
- "Your home's digital passport - built for you, not your contractor"
- Buyer owns the data (Cere personal data vault)
- Client-side encryption

### Gap 2: New Construction vs. Existing Buildings
**Current Market:** Renovation passports dominate EU policy

**Helder Positioning:**
- "The first digital passport for new construction buyers"
- Capture documentation from Day 1

### Gap 3: Blockchain Verification vs. "Trust Us" Databases
**Current Market:** Centralized databases (government or vendor-controlled)

**Helder Positioning:**
- "Cryptographic proof, not promises"
- DAC verification - mathematically verifiable
- Buyer controls keys

### Gap 4: Lifetime Value vs. Project Completion
**Current Market:** Tools end at handover

**Helder Positioning:**
- "From groundbreaking to grandchildren"
- Purchase → Construction → Handover → Maintenance → Sale → Next Owner

## 7. Battlecard - Key Objections & Responses

### "Why not just use Dropbox/Google Drive?"
**Response:**
- Dropbox doesn't verify timestamps
- No blockchain proof for warranty claims
- Contractors can revoke access
- **Kill shot:** "Can Dropbox prove to an insurance company that your contractor promised that fix on that date? Helder can."

### "My contractor already uses Procore/PlanRadar"
**Response:**
- Those platforms belong to the contractor, not you
- When project ends, your access often ends
- **Kill shot:** "What happens in 5 years when your contractor goes bankrupt? Their platform disappears. Helder is yours forever."

### "Flanders has a free government Woningpas"
**Response:**
- Woningpas is for existing buildings (renovation focus)
- Government platforms are slow to innovate
- Netherlands has no equivalent
- **Kill shot:** "Free government platforms are great at collecting taxes. For protecting your €500K investment, you want a platform built for you."

### "This feels like overkill for a house"
**Response:**
- Average nieuwbouw: €400K-700K (largest lifetime purchase)
- 5-20 year warranty liability with zero documentation
- **Kill shot:** "You insure your €30K car with a black box. Why not your €500K home?"

### "Contractors won't adopt this"
**Response:**
- They don't have to - you do
- Helder reduces contractor risk (proof of delivery)
