# Helder GTM Strategy: Dual-Motion B2C + B2B Launch

## TL;DR

**Dual motion:** B2C (homeowners) via assessment funnel + B2B (builders) via WhatsApp integration. First 50 users from Broersma Bureau network + kavelaars partnerships. €2,500 budget for 90 days. Kill signal: can't get 5 builders from dad's network.

---

## 1. Motion Fit Assessment

**Recommended: Dual B2C + B2B (not B2B2C)**

| Motion | Fit Score | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **B2C Direct (Families)** | Primary | Assessment funnel qualifies leads. Families building €400-700K homes are motivated, have budget, want transparency. |
| **B2B Direct (Builders)** | Primary | WhatsApp integration = zero friction. Builders already document via WhatsApp. We just capture and structure it. |
| **Partnership distribution** | Critical | Kavelaars, notaries, mortgage advisors touch families at decision moments. |

**Key insight:** Same dataset serves both. Builder uploads photo via WhatsApp → appears in homeowner dashboard. No duplicate work.

## 2. First 50 Users: 90-Day Playbook

### Days 1-30: Warm Network Activation

**Target: 5 builders + 10 families from Broersma Bureau network**

| Tactic | Action | Owner | Cost |
|--------|--------|-------|------|
| **Personal outreach** | Dad calls 20 builders in network. Pitch: "We're piloting digital Wkb docs, want early access?" | Dad + Martijn | €0 |
| **Proof of concept** | Use Helder on next 2-3 projects in network. Document everything. | Internal | €0 |
| **Builder WhatsApp group** | Create pilot group - share updates, get feedback. Position as exclusive. | Martijn | €0 |
| **Family direct outreach** | Contact families currently building via network. Offer free Helder passport. | Martijn | €0 |

**Message to builders:**
> "Wkb compliance is een administratieve hel. We built this to save ourselves hours per project. Want to try it on your next nieuwbouw? Just send photos via WhatsApp like you already do."

**Message to families:**
> "Je bouwt je droomhuis. Wij zorgen dat je alle documenten, foto's en garanties altijd bij de hand hebt - digitaal, veilig, voor altijd."

**Expected outcome:** 5 builders × 2 projects each = 10 families in system

---

### Days 31-60: Dual Channel Penetration

**Target: 25 users (split B2C + B2B)**

| Channel | Tactic | Cost | Expected |
|---------|--------|------|----------|
| **Assessment funnel (B2C)** | Launch 3-min quiz. Paid ads to "nieuwbouw bouwen" searches. Qualify → Wizard → Dashboard | €500 | 8 families |
| **Kavelaars (B2B2C)** | Partner with 2-3 kavelaars in Groningen/Friesland. "Give kavels buyers a digital passport from day 1." | €0 | 10 families |
| **Bouwbegeleiders (B2B)** | Target via LinkedIn. They send WhatsApp updates anyway - we just structure them. | €200 | 5 builders |
| **Local SEO** | "Wkb-eisen nieuwbouw 2026: Checklist" - rank for long-tail. | €0 | 2 families |

---

### Days 61-90: Referral Engine

**Target: 15 users via word-of-mouth**

| Program | Mechanics | Incentive |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Builder referral** | Builder who refers another builder gets €100 credit per project closed | Low cost, high leverage |
| **Family testimonials** | Video testimonials from first 10 families. YouTube/LinkedIn with "bouwdagboek" angle | Social proof |
| **Open house showcase** | Partner with 2 builders to show Helder at open houses | Zero cost, high intent |

**Milestone:** 50 real users by Day 90 (15 from network, 20 from channels, 15 from referrals)

---

## 3. Channel Prioritization Matrix

### Where Dutch nieuwbouw families hang out:

| Channel | Intent | Reach | Cost | Priority | Tactic |
|---------|--------|-------|------|----------|--------|
| **Assessment funnel (own)** | High | Low | €0 | #1 | Convert via quiz → wizard → dashboard |
| **Kavelaars websites** | High | Medium | €0 | #2 | Partnership listings, co-marketing |
| **Facebook groups** | Medium | High | €0 | #3 | Active participation, not ads |
| **LinkedIn (builders)** | Medium | Medium | € | #4 | B2B outreach |
| **Funda nieuwbouw** | High | High | €€€ | #5 | Only after PMF |
| **YouTube bouwvlogs** | Low | Medium | €€ | #6 | Sponsor later |

**Focus on #1-4 only until 50 users.**

---

## 4. Messaging Hierarchy

### A/B test these value props:

| Audience | Primary Hook | Supporting Proof | CTA |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-----|
| **Families (emotional)** | "Transparantie vanaf de eerste steen" | "Alle documenten, garanties en foto's - voor altijd veilig" | "Start de gratis test" |
| **Families (rational)** | "Wkb-compliant vanaf dag 1 - geen stress bij oplevering" | "Blockchain-geverifieerde bouwtijdlijn" | "Ontdek of je klaar bent" |
| **Builders** | "Stop met Excel en WhatsApp chaos - automatische Wkb-documentatie" | "Stuur gewoon foto's via WhatsApp. Wij doen de rest." | "Pilot met je volgende project" |
| **Kavelaars** | "Geef je kopers iets wat concurrent niet heeft" | "Premium kavelaars geven Helder cadeau" | "Partner met ons" |

**Winner prediction:** Families = transparency/trust. Builders = WhatsApp simplicity.

---

## 5. Builder Acquisition Playbook

### How to get builders to send photos via WhatsApp

**Insight:** Builders won't change behavior. We adapt to theirs.

| Barrier | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "I don't have time for new tools" | WhatsApp = they already use it. Zero learning curve. |
| "Why document more than required?" | CYA protection: "Prove work quality if client disputes later" |
| "What's in it for me?" | Referral bonuses + differentiation ("Helder-partner builder") |
| "Privacy concerns" | Client consent built in. Builders control what's shared. |

### Acquisition tactics:

**Phase 1: Broersma Network (Days 1-30)**
- Personal intro from dad
- Offer: "Test free on 1 project, we set everything up"
- Hand-hold first 5 builders

**Phase 2: Local Expansion (Days 31-90)**
- Sponsor local VOB event - €500
- LinkedIn: "Broersma Bureau built this, want early access?"
- Referral: €100 per builder referred

**Key metric:** Builder activation rate (% who send first photo within 7 days)

## 6. Partnership Opportunities

### Tier 1: Critical path

| Partner | Value Prop | Revenue Model | Priority |
|---------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Kavelaars** | "Premium plots come with Helder passport" | Rev share €50/family | #1 |
| **Notaries** | "Streamline Wkb verification at closing" | €25/transaction | #2 |
| **Banks (construction loans)** | "Digital proof of build progress for draws" | Enterprise license | #3 |

### Tier 2: Value-add

| Partner | Value Prop | Priority |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Mortgage advisors** | "Help clients prove build quality" | #4 |
| **Construction insurance** | "Verify build quality for claims" | #5 |

**Immediate focus:** Kavelaars + Notaries only until 100 users.

---

## 7. Budget Allocation (€2,500 for 90 days)

| Category | Spend | Expected Return |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Partnership materials** (deck, one-pagers) | €0 | Canva, DIY |
| **Local builder event sponsorship** | €500 | 15 builder leads |
| **Google Ads (assessment funnel)** | €500 | 15 family leads |
| **LinkedIn ads (target builders)** | €200 | 8 builder leads |
| **Referral bonuses** (5 builders × €100) | €500 | 10 families |
| **Video testimonials** (production) | €400 | Social proof |
| **Reserve** | €400 | Flex budget |

**Expected CAC:** €50/family (via builders), €0/family (via kavelaars)

---

## 8. KPIs & Tracking

### North Star: **Active projects using Helder**

| Metric | Week 4 | Week 8 | Week 12 |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Builders activated** | 5 | 12 | 20 |
| **Families onboarded** | 10 | 25 | 50 |
| **Photos uploaded** | 50 | 200 | 500 |
| **Kavelaars partnerships** | 1 | 2 | 3 |

### Kill signals
- Builder activation < 50% (product too complex)
- Photos/family < 10 after 30 days (no engagement)
- Zero kavelaars interest after 20 outreach (wrong value prop)

## 10. Why Dual Motion Works

### Same Dataset, Two Entry Points

```
BUILDER (B2B)                    HOMEOWNER (B2C)
     │                                │
     ▼                                ▼
WhatsApp photo ──────────────► Dashboard view
     │                                │
     ▼                                ▼

     │                                │

     │                                │
     └────────── SAME DATABASE ───────┘
```

**No duplicate work. Builder uploads → Family sees. Family uploads → Builder sees.**

## 11. Final Recommendation

**Phase 1 (Days 1-30): Prove it works**
- Use Helder on 3 projects in dad's network
- Onboard 5 builders + 10 families
- Validate WhatsApp ingestion workflow

**Phase 2 (Days 31-60): Find distribution**
- Close 1-2 kavelaars partnerships
- Scale assessment funnel

**Kill criteria:** Can't get 5 builders from dad's network = product needs work.

**Win criteria:** 50 users + 2 kavelaars partnerships = distribution model to scale.
