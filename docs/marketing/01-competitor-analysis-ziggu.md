## Sales Battle Card

### When Competing Against Ziggu

**If prospect says:** "We're looking at Ziggu"

**Response:**
> "Ziggu is great for large developers managing apartment complexes. But for custom home builders like you, Woningpaspoort is purpose-built. Three key differences:
> 
> 1. **Wkb Compliance**: We auto-generate the consumentendossier that Dutch law requires. Ziggu doesn't have this.
> 2. **Homeowner Focus**: Your families get a lifetime woningpaspoort they can use for 20+ years, not just during construction.
> 3. **Dutch Native**: We're built by a family that has completed 19,000+ projects in the Netherlands. We know your workflow."

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Ziggu has more features" | "They have features for developer workflows. We have what matters for nieuwbouw: Wkb compliance, material tracking, and a passport your buyers keep forever." |
| "Ziggu is more established" | "They're Belgian. We're Dutch. Built by Broersma Engineering - 68 years, 19,000+ projects. We understand Dutch construction regulations." |
| "Ziggu has better integrations" | "We integrate where it matters: WhatsApp for your builders on-site, and Wkb-compliant document structure. Fancy CRM integrations come later." |

## Recommended Actions

1. **Position on Wkb compliance** - This is the wedge Ziggu cannot easily copy
2. **Target custom home builders** - Ziggu's developer focus leaves this segment open
3. **Lead with heritage** - "19,000+ projects" counters Ziggu's funding/scale story
4. **Free homeowner tier** - Ziggu charges end-users; we don't
5. **Build WhatsApp-first** - Match builder workflow, not office software
6. **Monitor Ziggu Netherlands** - Track their expansion and respond fast
